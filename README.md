Hello Welcome to my Customer-Order Managing Database. This is a one way one to many Relationship. One being the customer and the orders being the many.Therefore we will see the orders table containing the foreign key.

1. To get started, you will want to get in your terminal and change your directory in to lib
2. Next type Python menu_selection.py and you should see a simple Command Line Interface.
3. The Database is already created.
3. If you would like to see all the current customers in the database, enter "1".
4. The number in front of the "Customer" will be the id you will use if you want to update the customer.

Thanks for trying out my CLI Program. Happy Coding!
